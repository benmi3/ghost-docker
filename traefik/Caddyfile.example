# This file has been replaced by Traefik configuration
# See traefik/traefik.yml and traefik/dynamic.yml for the new configuration
# 
# The equivalent Traefik configuration is now handled via:
# 1. Docker labels on services in compose.yml
# 2. Static configuration in traefik/traefik.yml  
# 3. Dynamic configuration in traefik/dynamic.yml
#
# Key differences from Caddy:
# - Automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt (configured in traefik.yml)
# - Service discovery via Docker labels
# - Middleware for security headers, compression, etc.
# - Dashboard available at traefik.${DOMAIN} (if enabled)
